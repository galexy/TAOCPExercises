When $n > m$, after the first iteration of E1, $m$ and $n$ will be swapped. 
Since, there are infinitely more cases where $n > m$, we can treat average 
number of steps using $T_{m}$ where $m$ is fixed. Therefore, $U_{m} = T_{m} + 1$ 
assuming that average is \emph{strongly} average, such that we can ignore how 
many times E1 is executed when $m \ge n$.
